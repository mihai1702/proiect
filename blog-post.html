                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">AI's ability to analyze vast amounts of clinical documentation quickly helps medical professionals identify disease markers and trends that would otherwise be overlooked.
                                        It all started in 2011 with IBM's Watson artificial intelligence system and now the biggest companies such as Apple, Microsoft and Amazon are investing in AI technologies for the healthcare sector.</p>
                                    <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Machine Learning</h2>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Machine learning is one of the most common examples of artificial intelligence and healthcare working together. Machine learning algorithms cand quicly process large amounts of clinical 
                                        documentation, identify patterns and make predictions about medical outcomes with greater accuracy than ever before. From analyzing patient records and medical imaging to discovering new therapies, the data 
                                        science behind machine learning is helping healthcare professionals improve their treatments and reduce costs.</p>
                                    <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Natural Language Processing(NLP)</h2>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Natural Language Processing(NLP) is a form of artificial intelligence that enables computers to interpret and use human language. This form of technology has reshaped many fields, including 
                                        the healthcare industry. In healthcare, NLP is being used in a wide range of health data applications, such as improving patient care through better diagnosis accuracy, streamlining clinical processes, and 
                                        providing more personalized services.</p>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">For example, NLP can be applied to medical records to accurately diagnose illnesses by extracting useful information from health data. Additionally, it can be used to identify relevant
                                         treatments and medications for each patient or even predict potential health risks based on past health data. Furthermore, NLP also provides clinicians with powerful tools for managing large amounts of 
                                         complex data - something which would normally take much longer to do manually.</p>
                                    <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Rule-Based Expert Systems</h2>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Expert systems based on variations of 'if-then' rules were the prevalent technology for AI in healthcare in the 80s and later periods. The use of artificial intelligence in healthcare is 
                                        widely used for clinical decision support to this day. Many electronic health record systems (EHRs) currently make available a set of rules with their software offerings.</p>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Expert systems function well up to a point and are easy to follow and process. But as the number of rules grows too large, usually exceeding several thousand, the rules can begin to conflict
                                         with each other and fall apart. Also, if the knowledge area changes in a significant way, changing the rules can be burdensome and laborious. Machine learning in healthcare is slowly replacing rule-based systems 
                                         with approaches based on interpreting data using proprietary medical algorithms.</p>
                                    <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Administrative Applications</h2>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Artificial Intelligence in healthcare is changing many of the administrative aspects of medical care. By automating mundane tasks, such as data entry, claims processing and appointment scheduling, using 
                                        artificial intelligence in healthcare can free up time for providers and healthcare organizations to focus on patient care and revenue cycle management. Furthermore, artificial intelligence also has the potential to reduce 
                                        human error by providing a faster way to review health records, medical imaging, claims processing and test results. With artificial intelligence giving medical professionals more autonomy over their workflow process, they 
                                        are able to provide better quality patient care while maintaining budget efficiency. The ability of AI in healthcare to analyze the medical history of a patient and deliver better and faster results is reshaping the way healthcare
                                         providers deliver care, making it possible for them to devote more time and resources to their patients. With artificial intelligence AI in healthcare leading the charge in improving patient care, medical professionals can be 
                                         confident that they can focus on delivering quality care while also saving time and money with AI-powered administrative tasks.</p>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Ultimately, artificial intelligence in healthcare offers a refined way for healthcare providers to deliver better and faster patient care. By automating mundane administrative tasks, artificial intelligence can help 
                                        medical professionals save time and money while also giving them more autonomy over their workflow process</p>
